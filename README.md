# Paper Skater
Arts and crafts/skateboarding themed side scroller.

## Idea
I wanted to create a simple side scroller game in the vein of paper boy, but for skateboarding.
Inspired by some origami I saw, I decided on theme where the items used where made with paper
like materials.

## Instructions
You must avoid running into both the flowers and the birds. In order to avoid them you use the
left and right arrow keys to move back and forth and the space bar to jump. Remeber, you can
not move while jumping nor jump while moving.

## Bugs
After jumping and before landing if you move the character either left or right it will glitch
having the character endlessly jump until it inevitably crashes into either the birds or flowers.
The current workaround is to express these limitations in the instructions, but I hope to fix 
this shortly.
